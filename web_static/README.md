# Web Static
During this project, I acquired the skills to work with both HTML and CSS languages.
HTML serves as the foundation for web pages, defining their structure and content,
and it is typically the first language used when building a webpage.
CSS, on the other hand, is responsible for styling and designing the page, determining
how it looks and is presented to users. In the development process, it's common practice
to establish the HTML structure before proceeding with CSS styling, ensuring a solid structural
foundation before enhancing the design.
